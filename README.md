Name:Ehan Holohan

Student Number: C20322553

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment

Our goal with this assignment was to make a musicvideo using java code that reacts to the audio of the song

# Instructions

run main located in File c20322553

# How it works

it works mostly by using a combination of functions that run temporary effects and a renderlist, which contains objects that are rendered in order, the classes for these shapes are located in the shape.java file

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

Im proud of the renderlist and associated shape objects as it allows for easy rendering of persitant objects

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
